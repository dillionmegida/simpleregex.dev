Moving on to a more advanced concept in regular expressions: **lookarounds** ðŸ‘€

Let's say we had a string example like this:

> He has 20 dollars and is 10 years old

Say you wanted to write a pattern that would match this person's age, what would it be?

You might think:

```txt
/``\d+``/g
```

First we have `\d`, a digit <CourseLink path='meta-characters' label='meta character' /> which matches digits. Then we have the **ONE or MORE** <CourseLink path='special-characters' label='special character' />. This pattern means "one or more digits":

<Regex pattern="/\d+/g" input="He has 20 dollars and is 10 years old" />

From the matches, we see "20" and "10". But our target is only "10" ðŸ¤”. You could then expand the regular expression to this:

<Regex
  pattern="/\d+ years old/g"
  input="He has 20 dollars and is 10 years old"
/>

Now we have "10 years old" as a match. But, this includes other characters we're not interested in: " years old". So how can we specifically target the number that "is followed by" the characters " years old" without matching " years old"? Lookaround patterns to the rescue.

In the same vain, say we had a string like:

> He bought 50 items with $500

How do we match the number that is preceded by "$" without matching "$"? Lookaround patterns.

## What are Lookaround Patterns?

In Regex, you can create lookaround patterns. What this means is that you specify a pattern, let's call this `pattern A`, then you have a lookaround pattern, let's call this `pattern B`. The idea is that the regex engine will look for a match for `pattern A`, then it will look around this match to see if it can find a match for `pattern B`. If it finds a match for `pattern B`, then the match for `pattern A` is valid. But if it does not find a match for `pattern B`, then the match for `pattern A` is not a valid match.

<Important>

You can think of lookaround patterns like a checker: "Check around if this match has these characters".

</Important>

Don't worry if this does not make sense. We'll look at examples to simplify this.

## Types of Lookaround Patterns

Lookarounds can be divided into two:

- Lookahead (that is, in front of the match) and
- Lookbehind (that is, before the match)
