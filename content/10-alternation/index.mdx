Previously, we looked at <CourseLink path='character-class' label='character classes' /> which allows you to specify a "this or that". Another similar concept in regular expressions is **alternation**, also called **alternating characters**.

## What is Alternation?

Alternation allows you to specify a "this" or "that" character or group of characters. You create them with the pipe `|` symbol. For example:

```txt
/this``|``that/g
```

This pattern will match the characters "this" or "that":

<Regex pattern="/this|that/g" input="I love this but I do not love that" />

Because we have the `g` <CourseLink path='flags' label='flag' />, this pattern matches "this" and "that".

How does this differ from character classes?

## Alternation vs Character Classes

The difference is:

<Important>
  Character classes only allows you to provide characters: `[abc]`. It does not
  allow you to provide other expressions like groups and quantifiers.
</Important>

For example, let's say you have a character class of the `\w` meta character, and the `+` plus quantifier which means 1 OR MORE:

```txt
/``[\w+]``/
```

Passing plus `+` in a character class will treat it as a “normal character” and not a quantifier. Every special character in a character class is treated as a normal character.

<Regex pattern="/[\w+]/g" input="he likes to ping $&6...what is +ing" />

As you can see above, every character except "$" and "&" are not matched. These are the only characters that are neither `\w` (word characters) nor `+` in the character class.

Also if you attempt to have groups in a character class, like this:

```txt
/[(ha)]ing/
```

It also won't work, as the parentheses would be treated as normal bracket characters. So, this character class would mean “open parentheses (” or “h” or “a” or “close parentheses )”.

<Regex pattern="/[(ha)]ing/g" input="random characters: (ing, aing, )ing" />

From the matches, you see "(ing", "aing", and ")ing", because they begin with a character from the character class followed by "ing".

This is how alternation is different.

<Important>
  Unlike character classes, alternation allows you to combine other special
  characters in your "this or that" pattern.
</Important>

With alternation, you can provide expressions like characters, groups, quantifiers or any other valid regular expression. For example:

```txt
/th``(is|at)``/
```

Here we have a <CourseLink path='capturing-groups' label='group' /> and in it, we use alternation to indicate "is" or "at". So the pattern here means:

"t" followed by "h" followed by "is" or "at":

<Regex pattern="/th(is|at)/g" input="he said this, he didn't say that" />

<Info>
  The orange colors signifies the groups that are captured. Remember you can
  turn off capturing with a question mark followed by a colon in the group:
  `(?:..)`
</Info>

Let's see another example. Let's say we had a string like:

> "I grabbed a refreshing can of Coca-Cola, or as some people call it, Coke, while others prefer to refer to it as Coca Cola"

And you want to match "Coca-Cola", "Coke" and "Coca Cola". Here are few ways you can use alternation for this:

<Regex
  pattern="/Coca-Cola|Coke|Coca Cola/ig"
  input="I grabbed a refreshing can of Coca-Cola, or as some people call it, Coke, while others prefer to refer to it as Coca Cola"
/>

<Info>The `i` flag to turn off case restriction.</Info>

Here we basically said "Coca-Cola" or "Coke" or "Coca Cola". Very easy to read, but we can make this shorter.

---

<Regex
  pattern="/Co(ca-Cola|ke|ca Cola)/ig"
  input="I grabbed a refreshing can of Coca-Cola, or as some people call it, Coke, while others prefer to refer to it as Coca Cola"
/>

Very slightly shorter, but what we're doing here is "Co" followed by:

- "co-Cola" or
- "ke" or
- "ca Cola"

And of course, the groups are captured.

Now let's make this shorter.

---

<Regex
  pattern="/Co(ca(-| )Cola|ke)/ig"
  input="I grabbed a refreshing can of Coca-Cola, or as some people call it, Coke, while others prefer to refer to it as Coca Cola"
/>

Here we say, "Co" followed by:

- "ca" followed by
  - "- or |"
  - followed by "Cola"
- "ke"

Though shorter, this becomes complex, and readibility becomes difficult. Like I mentioned at the beginning of this course, there are many patterns you can write to achieve the same thing, but always keep reability in mind.

In this pattern, we have a nested group `ca(-| )` which includes an alternation between "ca-" and "ca ". This way, we can match Co`ca-`Cola and Co`ca `Cola. While this does the job, I'd rather use our earlier solution:

```txt
/Coca-Cola``|``Coke``|``Coca Cola/ig
```

This is easier to read and pretty clear what we're trying to achieve.
