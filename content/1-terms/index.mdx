When talking about Regex patterns, there are a some terms you’d hear a lot and it’s important to understand them. Let’s look at them:

## String

First term is String.

A string is a combination of characters which you apply a regular expression to. A string can be a letter, like “a”; it can be a word like “javascript” or it can be a sentence like “I bought 2 shoes for $5 from the market”. When you apply a pattern on a string, you can get the parts of that string (which we can call substrings) that match.

## Digits

Another term is Digits.

Digits refers to numbers, which are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9

## Letters

Or you can also call them alphabets, which refers to A, B, C to Z

Letters can be of different cases. You can have uppercase A, B, C, and lowercase a, b, c.

## Symbols

A symbol is a character, which you can call a sign. These are not letters or digits. They are characters that can have special meanings. For examples:

- the dollar $ sign
- the period . sign
- the plus + sign
- the exclamation sign
- the backward slash \ sign
- and many more…

There are so many symbol characters, and as we will see in this course, some of these characters can perform different functions in regex patterns.

## Whitespace

A whitespace is a character, or you can call it a space, refers to a vertical or horizontal space.

**For the horizontal space:**

You have the single space which is the space between these words in “Hello world”

You also have the tab space which is longer than a single space. You can see it between these words in “Hello world”

**For the vertical space:**

You have the **newline** character which is the space between one line and another. For example

```txt
Hello
World
```

This can also be called a line break.

## Character

When you see “character”, it means digits, or letters, or symbols or whitespaces. All of these classifies as characters. A string can be made up of one or more characters.

## Pattern

This refers to a regular expression, which can match a combination of characters. A pattern can be as simple as… for example can be number, followed by string, followed by number. Or it can symbol, followed by 4 letter words, a space, and one letter.

When you see or hear me saying pattern, regex, regex pattern, or regular expression, I’m referring to the same thing. I’ll use these words interchangeably in this course

## Flags

Regular Expression patterns have some behaviours by default. Flags are optional characters you can add to the end of your pattern to change some of those default behaviours.

## Summary

Here’s a summary of all these terms on the screen. We’ll use these terms in several videos in this course, so it’s important to keep them in mind, so that you understand the things I explain.

Now, let’s move on to learning how to create a regex pattern.
